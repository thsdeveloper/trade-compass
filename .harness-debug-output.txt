  "description": "Add passwordless authentication using magic links sent via email. Users enter their email, receive a secure one-time link, and are authenticated automatically when clicking it. This integrates with existing Supabase authentication (F001) using Supabase's signInWithOtp method. The feature includes email input UI, link generation on backend, email delivery, and automatic session creation upon link click.",
